[Node.js] (1)server-side and networking applications, written in JavaScript
          (2)Node.js shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over websockets. 
          (3)The main idea of Node.js: use non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient, 
                   in the face of data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
          (4)Node.js operates on a single thread, using non-blocking I/O calls.
             The design goal of a Node.js application is that any function performing I/O must use a callback.

[Express js] 
    - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    - Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines
    - A web application framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It is the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

    [Process manager] http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/pm.html
        When you run Express apps for production, it is helpful to use a process manager to achieve the following tasks:
                             - Restart the app automatically if it crashes.
                             - Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.
                             - Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.
                             - Control clustering.
        A process manager is somewhat like an application server: it’s a “container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.
        The most popular process managers for Express and other Node.js applications are as follows:
                              - StrongLoop Process Manager
                              - PM2
                              - Forever
                              - SystemD
